            <big>Hello again, my name is Yasya, I'm 15 years old and I'm a creative person. A little more than two years I'm fond
              of photography. I like to watch nature and people. For people especially! So most of my work is portraits.Since
              my childhood I love to sing. In the fourth form I even won the audience prize at a competition. Later I tried
              to play the guitar. But now I have enough piano and my voice to satisfy my musical "needs")) Also, throughout
              my life I did various physical exercises. Yoga, acrobatics, even went to the gym, but the biggest place in
              my heart take a dance. For four years i went to dance school and it was wonderful. But unfortunately our dance
              team broke up and i started looking for a new hobby. I chose LITS because i had only a little more than a year
              left before graduation and it's time to think about my future. The sphere of IT technologies in one of the
              most on demand now.

            <big>Hello, my name is Sonya, I'm 12 years old, I'm engaged in fencing, music, Math, English and German, theater,
              clothing modeling,also I studied folk dances. We often went to competitions and took first place. I really
              love animals and so I have a lot of pets: cat, fish and snails. But my dream is a dog of the shih tzu breed.
              I also like drawing, especially painting pictures by numbers or coloring the antistress. I believe that the
              most important thing in a person's life is development. So I got interested in programming and went to LITS.

            <font face="verdana">Hi! My name is Liza, I’m 14. I’m a calm and a quiet girl.I like drawing and reading. I’m plodding person so I
              can do something and it not annoyed me, that help me studying good at school. I think l’m creative person,
              l like draw and I do this well. Recently I became interested in programming and I like it so I came to LITS.
              Here I found new acquaintances with whom I got on well, and I hope that we will communicate for a long time.
              Also, here I learned a lot of new things in programming and learned how to work in a team. In our team, I am
              the project manager. LITS helped me to open leadership qualities, although to me, as a not very open person,
              it was not easy. I like developing myself in the IT-sphere and I'm sure that it will help me in the future.

            <font face="verdana">Hello! My name is Vanya, and I am 15 years old. I was engaged in table tennis,but it has being lasted for a year,
              but then I lost interest in this sport. Also, I am engaged in football, I know that it was not serious, but
              it was for fun, maybe it was because I like team sports, I like to do something with the team and take part
              in achieving our goal, as it is in LITS, every person should bring something to the project. I came to LITS
              to discover new subjects such as programming, critical thinking, soft skills, and also to improve my English.
