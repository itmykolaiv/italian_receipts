        <h1>About Italian Food</h1>
        <p> <big> <font face="verdana"> Italian cuisine is food typical from Italy. It has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, with
          roots stretching to antiquity. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction
          of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century.
          Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of the Italian
          peninsula. It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world. It influenced
          several cuisines around the world chiefly that of the United States. Italian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity,
          with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients
          rather than on elaborate preparation.Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional,
          have proliferated with variations throughout the country. Pasta, vegetables, olive oil and fish are a major part
          of the Italian cuisine. Italian cuisine is probably the most important expression of the mediterranean diet.</font></big></p>
          <p><big><font face ="verdana"> History </font></big></p>
		
        <p><big><font face ="verdana">Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the 19th
          century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Food and culture was very important
          at that time as we can see from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates back to first century BC. Through the centuries,
          neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval and the discovery of the New World have
          influenced its development. Italian food started to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities
          began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was
          a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. For example, the north of Italy (Milan)
          is known for its risottos, the central/middle of the country (Bologna) is known for its tortellini and the south
          (Naples) is famous for its pizzas and spaghettis.<a href="#" class="readmore">read more</font></a></big></p>
